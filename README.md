# Tip
Tippy Tippy

This is an iOS app for calculating tips. (max amount users could input is $9999.99)

Time spent: I spent 4 hours the first time with the video and the basic app set up, 
including making the customized keyboard. After that, it was many hours of reading and trying. 
Total would be less than 24 hours but there were a lot of reading and thinking inbetween,
so total would be more than that I think.

Required Tasks:
Users can calculate tips using this app. (18%, 20%, 22%)

Optional Tasks:
Changed the colors/fonts
Added constraints
Added a custom font
Added app icons and launch image
Added animation to the input text (shake)
Added images to Image Assets
Added customized keyboard to input
Added constratins to elements
Used auto layout

Below is my demo of this app. The recording doesn't show the shake effect for input text too well. The actual app shakes smoother and faster :)
