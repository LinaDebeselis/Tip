# Tip
Tippy Tippy

This is an iOS app for calculating tips. (max amount users could input is $9999.99)

Time spent: I spent 4 hours the first time with the video and the basic app set up, 
including making the customized keyboard. After that, it was many hours of reading and trying. 
Total would be less than 24 hours but there were a lot of reading and thinking inbetween,
so total would be more than that I think.

Changed the colors/fonts

Added a custom font
Added app icons and launch image
Added animation to the input text (shake)
