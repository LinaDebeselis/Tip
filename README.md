# Tip
Tippy Tippy

This is an iOS app with customized keyboard for calculating tips. (max amount users could input is $9999.99)

Time spent: I spent 4 hours the first time with the video and the basic app set up, 
including making the customized keyboard. After that, it was many hours of reading and trying. 
Total would be less than 24 hours but there were a lot of reading and thinking in between,
so total would be more than that I think.

Required Tasks:
* [x] Users can input bill amount to calculate tips. (18%, 20%, 22%)
* [x] Users can view their tip amount and total amount

Optional Tasks:
* [x] Changed the colors/fonts
* [x] Added constraints
* [x] Added a custom font
* [x] Added app icons and launch image
* [x] Added animation to the input text (shake)
* [x] Added animation to totalLabel
* [x] Added images to Image Assets
* [x] Added customized keyboard to input
* [x] Added constratins to elements
* [x] Used auto layout
* [x] Added customized logo

Below is my demo of this app. The recording doesn't show the shake effect for input text too well. The actual app shakes smoother and faster :)
